# Velto *(Alpha)*  
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/aven0xx/Velto)](https://github.com/aven0xx/Velto/blob/main/LICENSE) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/aven0xx/Velto)](https://github.com/aven0xx/Velto/releases/latest)

> **⚠ Alpha Notice:** Velto is a **small, lightweight core plugin** built with the help of AI and refined over time. It was imagined as a **simple, plug-and-play core** that doesn't need frequent updates, is easy to extend, and works well alongside other major plugins. 

**Velto** is not meant to replace big all-in-one solutions like Essentials, CMI, or EternalCore. Instead, it focuses on providing a minimal set of utilities and a configurable message system. It can be used as:
- A **simple core** for standalone servers.
- A **foundation plugin** in a cross-server setup, leaving things like economy, homes, and teleports to dedicated plugins.

## 🚦 Philosophy
- **Keep it light:** Minimal features, no unnecessary systems.
- **Play well with others:** Designed to work with existing plugins without overlap.
- **Easy to set up:** Drop it in, start the server, and it works.
- **Extendable:** Clean architecture so you can add your own features.
